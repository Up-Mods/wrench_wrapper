Wrench Wrapper is a portable way to use [Quilt Config](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config) on modern Minecraft toolchains. It minimizes bloat so that your mod can just bundle our wrapper in order to have fun with an excellent config system!

While [the Quilt project](https://quiltmc.org/) has unfortunately fallen out of relevancy, it still aims to avoid relocating the API so that *all* platforms can have a seamless experience!

Stay tuned for more, there's more work to do.
