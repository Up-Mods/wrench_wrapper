# Wrench Wrapper

An absolute genius* way of using your Quilt Config with:
 - No relocating your packages!
 - No losing updates from your local Quilt Loader!
 - No relying on spiteful racistware! Rely on desperate sellout instead!

Footnote: Wrench Wrapper may require a Part 2 hosted on your mod in order to semi-agnostically create your config.
